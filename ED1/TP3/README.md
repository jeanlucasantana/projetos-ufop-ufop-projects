# BCC202-TP03
Simulates a cellular automaton with cells stored using a hash table for memory efficiency. Only active cells are tracked, allowing large or sparse grids with minimal overhead. Supports custom rulesets (e.g., Conway's Game of Life) and infinite grid simulation without predefined boundaries.
